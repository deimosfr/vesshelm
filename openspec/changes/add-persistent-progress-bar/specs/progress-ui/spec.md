## ADDED Requirements

#### Scenario: Visual Indication of Overall Progress
- **Given** I run `vesshelm sync` or `vesshelm deploy`
- **When** the operation has multiple items to process (e.g. 5 charts)
- **Then** I should see a progress bar at the bottom of the screen indicating the percentage completion (e.g. "20%", "40%").
- **And** the progress bar should remain at the bottom while logs appear above it.

#### Scenario: Clean Output Without Glitches
- **Given** a long running deployment
- **When** logs are generated by the process (internal or external tools like Helm)
- **Then** the progress bar should not be duplicated or broken by the log lines.
- **And** the global progress should persist until the entire operation is finished.

#### Scenario: Fancy Aesthetics
- **Given** the progress bar is displayed
- **Then** it should use colors (e.g. cyan/blue for the bar).
- **And** it should use high-resolution block characters (e.g. █, ▌) instead of simple ASCII (`=`, `>`).
